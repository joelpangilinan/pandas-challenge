ANALYSIS SUMMARY:
* The highest performing schools are charter type schools and the lowest performing schools are district type schools.
* Charter type schools tend have a lower student population compared to the district type of schools. 
* The reading scores tend to be better across the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th grades compared to their math scores.
* The spend per student is not a factor on math and reading scores per school.
* The math and reading scores tend to go down if the population of students exceed 2000. 
* The size or student population of small and medium sized schools is not a factor on students’ academic performance.

CONCLUSIONS:
	The charter type of schools tends to do better academically than schools from the district.  This is due to lower student population wherein a school can better manage the students given the budget they have.  The distribution of students between district and charter type of schools is uneven which tends to affect the overall reading and math scores of the students.
